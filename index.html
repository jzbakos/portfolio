        <p>
          This project was a great way for me to improve and showcase my
          knowledge on database design and web development/design. Along with
          those, communication and collaboration were both extremely important
          over the course of this project’s development. I was lucky enough to
          work with two students (Jack Ingram and Jarod Colley) that I have
          worked with before, which helped a lot in terms of chemistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose to work together as much as possible to ensure equal
          distribution of responsibility and workload. To do this, once or twice
          a week since the beginning of the semester we would get into a Discord
          call for a few hours and work through whatever we had to. This worked
          very well for us, we were always either on-track or ahead of schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say that we had a relatively balanced workload and each member
          of the team was necessary and useful throughout the duration of this
          project.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container section" id="section-communication">
        <h1 class="title-text">Communication</h1>
        <hr class="title" />
        <p>
          Every member of the team had excellent communication throughout the
          duration of the project. We created an all-purpose Discord group chat
          to use as our primary communication medium. Anytime a message was sent
          in the chat, one of the members would usually respond in less than 30
          minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were never any issues with communication from anyone. I made sure
          to respond to any message ASAP. We also set meetings once or twice per
          week where we would get into a Discord call for an hour or two to coordinate.
          Then we would just do our tasks and update each other next meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          We had flawless communication throughout this project. I do think the 
          communication was better due to the online format. Everyone is always
          home and near a device.

      <div class="container section" id="section-qq">
        <h1 class="title-text">My Contribution</h1>
        <hr class="title" />

        <p>
          I’m confident that I contributed a sufficient amount to this project -
          if anything, I most likely contributed <i>more</i> than needed. The website
          development and design is my most significant contribution. I also
          assisted with writing the project report document, however, I would
          say I contributed more to the website than the report.
        </p>

        <div class="row" id="graphs">
          <div class="col">
            <h4 class="heading">Application Development & Design</h4>
            <div id="piechart" style="width: 310px; margin: auto"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h4 class="heading">Database Design & Report</h4>
            <div id="piechart2" style="width: 310px; margin: auto"></div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          I would consider the quantity and quality of my contributions to both
          be very high, especially when talking about the application design and
          functionality. I created the website structure, hosted the application
          and database online, and designed most of the website. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To be clear: I
          chose to work many <strong>extra</strong> hours on designs that were not needed. I plan to
          use this website as a portfolio piece in the future and wanted to
          improve it every chance I could. There were a few nights I found myself
          up until 2 AM after falling into the rabbit hole of design improvements.
          Jack and Jarod were both very helpful when implementing small-medium
          functionality on the website too. Also, Jack was mainly in charge of
          the video editing and creation, which he did an amazing job on.

          Looking back, I wouldn’t say that I learned anything new in regards to
          collaboration, but I definitely did improve in a lot of areas. As a
          new-ish developer/student I was very pleased to see all the higher
          level database design concepts come into play when structuring the
          application. As soon as the report and database design aspects were
          finished, it was just a matter of putting the pieces together. It’s
          nice to see years of theory turn into practice and I am excited to
          further explore the benefits of database design concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I feel that each member of this group, myself included,
          contributed and collaborated wonderfully. I learned a lot along the
          way and am very proud of the final product.
